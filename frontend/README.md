# LiftUp

A simple workout planner with similar features as a To-Do List. 

This side project served as my practice for improving my skills in React, Tailwind CSS, and the likes of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I also applied coding practices I've learned from the tutorials and articles I've found online that helped make this project a lot easier to navigate and read.

Hope you like this one! I definitely still have a lot to learn but it was a fun experience making this side project!
